Grocery Cart Android App

INTRODUCTION
Overview
I have created a beautiful and efficient Android App to which on a single click of a button user can add grocery items to buy which gets stored in the form of a list.

Purpose of Making the App
Many times we forget to purchase things that we want to buy, after all, we can’t remember all the items, so with the help of this app, we can note down our grocery items that we are going to purchase, by doing this we can’t forget any items that we want to purchase.

LITERATURE SURVEY
Existing problem
As we cannot remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. 

Proposed solution
With the assistance of this Android app, users can make a list of the groceries they intend to buy so that they do not forget anything. Note that I have implemented this project using the Kotlin language.

Why making a grocery list is important?
This is a text I read from someone's blog.
But please note the last line highlighted which inspired me to make this project:
Many organizational experts recommend making some type of list with similar items placed together. Grouping foods by category on your grocery list helps you remember food items and avoid a return trip to the store. Also, by grouping foods together, you are less likely to double back in the store for a food missed when in a particular section.
To save time, you might develop a form you can photocopy or print from your computer for weekly use. Keep your list in a central location where your family can add to it as needed. Some people keep it on their refrigerator with one of those strong magnetic clips. Other people store theirs in a cupboard drawer. Be sure there is a pencil nearby, or if possible, attach your pencil to a string! You might also consider taking a picture of your list with your phone before you head to the store.
Or ... rather than a paper and pencil list, you might check out the various apps that help you keep your list on your smart phone. Some of them can be synced across various devices and even shared with others. Added features for some include information on related coupons, recipes, healthy food recommendations and more. Before paying for an app, try some of the free ones first to see how you like this method of keeping a grocery list. Or, if you already use an app to keep lists, include groceries among the lists you set up.

ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES
Advantages
Offers a way to increase productivity, stopping you from forgetting things, helps prioritise tasks, manage tasks effectively, use time wisely and improve time management as well as workflow.
Disadvantages
This app has no disadvantages.

APPLICATIONS
Common people who need to note down daily items they will buy.
Old people or people suffering from alzheimer's disease.
Shopkeepers who need to keep a immediate note of items purchased by a customer along by calculating the total price.

CONCLUSION
Finally with all the above findings and research I have successfully created the Grocery List App named 'MY CART' .

FUTURE SCOPE
Next I plan to make some changes to the UI of the app to make it look more attractive and user friendly.
